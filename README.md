# Analysing UK House Price Index Using Apache Pig

**Key Findings:** Brexit and COVID-19 are factors that can be considered to have cause increase in house prices in most regions accross the UK. Aberdeen house prices has not experience increase post BREXIT and COVID-19 compared to other cities.

## Motivation
Asset price fluctuation, especially house prices is one of the fundamental driving factors in every economy. 
Analysing this fluctuations overtime provides a good understanding of investments and strategies. House 
prices and financial time series share a lot of properties together (Begiazi 2009). This makes examining and 
analysing the housing market very important.
Recent financial activities have increased the level of uncertainty in housing market globally. The United 
Kingdom especially has been hit with events such as the Brexit referendum, immigration policies and COVID -
19. While the housing market generally has a high correlation with structural breaks, the United Kingdom 
particularly has a strong evidence of house price crashes. An example is the early 2000 house prices bubble, 
which was followed by a drastic drop of up to 15% in house prices in 2008.

## Analysis
The following three questions is proposed. Each question is analysed using Apache PIG. Screenshot of 
outputs are provided for each analysis to further discussions. 
1. How has economic and global events (UK referendum, COVID - 19) affected UK house prices.
2. What is the rate of mortgage to outright property purchase over the years.
3. What time of the year usually experiences high volume of property sales.

## Dataset
Data from the UK & NI Residential Property was used to perform analysis and answer the questions. The 
data repository contains regional sales data across various attributes from 1995 to 2022. From this 
repository, I have made use of two datasets.
• UK Government House Price Index (HPI)
• Cash-Mortgage sales
